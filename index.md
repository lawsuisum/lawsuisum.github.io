## Welcome to sslaw's blog!

I am currently an undergraduate student major in computer science in ZJU. My main interests are optimizations and machine learning scenarios.
This page is not always serious and academic. I will (in)frequently share some interesting experiences [here](https://github.com/lawsuisum/lawsuisum.github.io). 

Welcome, and have fun!

### Projects
